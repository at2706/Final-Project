I put the dll and assets in their own directories to be more organized.

Configuration Properties > Debugging
	Working Directory	$(ProjectDir)..\Assets
	Environment		PATH=%PATH%;$(ProjectDir)..\dll

C/C++ 
	Additional Include Directories	C:\SDL2\include;C:\SDL2_image\include;C:\SDL2_mixer\include

Linker > General
	Additional Library Directories	C:\SDL2\lib\x86;C:\SDL2_image\lib\x86;C:\SDL2_mixer\lib\x86;%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)
Linker > Input
	Additional Library Directories	SDL2.lib;SDL2main.lib;SDL2_image.lib;OpenGL32.lib;SDL2_mixer.lib
